  <h2>What Is a Black Swan?</h2>
  <p>A black swan is an <b><u>unpredictable</u></b> event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight.</p>
  <h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>
  <p>A black swan is an extremely rare event with severe consequences. It cannot be predicted beforehand, though after the fact, many falsely claim it should have been predictable.</p>
  <p>Black swan events can cause <a href="https://en.dict.naver.com/#/search?query=catastrophe&range=all" target="_blank" title="specific of define">catastrophic</a> damage to an economy by negatively impacting markets and investments, but even the use of robust modeling cannot prevent a black swan event.</p>
  <p>Reliance on standard forecasting tools can both fail to predict and potentially increase vulnerability to black swans by propagating risk and offering false security.</p>
